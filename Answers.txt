Coding

    1. What effect did applying the rules have on your code?
         
       Due to the usage of only if statement and one level of indentation, code became more readable, modularized and              maintainable. I changed the access modifier of the attributes to public. This has exposed the data.Getter/Setters           are useful methods. We can achieve encapsulation with Getter/Setter methods and protect the data. 
    
    
    2. Anything that became better?
        
       Code became more readable, modularized and maintainable.


    
    
    3. Anything that became worse?

    4. What's your impression and understanding of the frameworks and libraries we've used here?
        
       Initially I thought that the assignment was easy and doable. After some time I realized that it is little bit               difficult. I got stuck at four test cases. I tried to fix that. But I couldn't. Overall I enjoyed the assignment and        learned new things. 
    

Deployment
    
    1. How do you feel about shipping and deploying code yourself?        
       In my current project, Developers deploy their code in the production. It's good practice.
    

    2. Who do you think should be responsible for code running in production?        
       Developers need to deploy and run the code in the production.
